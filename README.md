## How do I install it?


### Basic: It is more likely to work on your computer but it will also be very slow. You can follow instructions for the basic install (This usually runs via **CPU**)
#### 1.Setup your platform
-   python (3.10 recommended)
-   pip
-   git
-   [ffmpeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlNWCpFdVMA) 
-   [visual studio 2022 runtimes (windows)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
#### 2. Clone Repository
    https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam.git

#### 3. Download Models

 1. [GFPGANv1.4](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/GFPGANv1.4.pth)
 2. [inswapper_128_fp16.onnx](https://huggingface.co/hacksider/deep-live-cam/resolve/main/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx) *(Note: Use this [replacement version](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion-assets/releases/download/models/inswapper_128_fp16.onnx) if an issue occurs on your computer)*

Then put those 2 files on the "**models**" folder

#### 4. Install dependency
We highly recommend to work with a  `venv`  to avoid issues.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For MAC OS, You have to install or upgrade python-tk package:
```
brew install python-tk@3.10
```
##### DONE!!! If you don't have any GPU, You should be able to run roop using `python run.py` command. Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.

#### 5. Proceed if you want to use GPU acceleration (optional)

## How do I use it?
> Note: When you run this program for the first time, it will download some models ~300MB in size.

Executing `python run.py` command will launch this window:
![gui-demo](instruction.png)

Choose a face (image with desired face) and the target image/video (image/video in which you want to replace the face) and click on `Start`. Open file explorer and navigate to the directory you select your output to be in. You will find a directory named `<video_title>` where you can see the frames being swapped in realtime. Once the processing is done, it will create the output file. That's it.

## For the webcam mode
Just follow the clicks on the screenshot
1. Select a face
2. Click live
3. Wait for a few seconds (it takes a longer time, usually 10 to 30 seconds before the preview shows up)

![demo-gif](demo.gif)

Just use your favorite screencapture to stream like OBS
> Note: In case you want to change your face, just select another picture, the preview mode will then restart (so just wait a bit).

### Webcam mode on Windows 11 using WSL2 Ubuntu (optional)

<details>
<summary>Click to see the details</summary>

If you want to use WSL2 on Windows 11 you will notice, that Ubuntu WSL2 doesn't come with USB-Webcam support in the Kernel. You need to do two things: Compile the Kernel with the right modules integrated and forward your USB Webcam from Windows to Ubuntu with the usbipd app. Here are detailed Steps:

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up WSL2 Ubuntu with USB webcam support, rebuilding the kernel, and preparing the environment for the Deep-Live-Cam project.  
  
#### 1. Install WSL2 Ubuntu  
  
Install WSL2 Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store or using PowerShell:  
  
#### 2. Enable USB Support in WSL2  
  
1. Install the USB/IP tool for Windows:  
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb)  
  
2. In Windows PowerShell (as Administrator), connect your webcam to WSL:  
  
```powershell  
usbipd list  
usbipd bind --busid x-x # Replace x-x with your webcam's bus ID  
usbipd attach --wsl --busid x-x # Replace x-x with your webcam's bus ID  
```  
 You need to redo the above every time you reboot wsl or re-connect your webcam/usb device.
 
#### 3. Rebuild WSL2 Ubuntu Kernel with USB and Webcam Modules  
  
Follow these steps to rebuild the kernel:  
  
1. Start with this guide: [https://github.com/PINTO0309/wsl2_linux_kernel_usbcam_enable_conf](https://github.com/PINTO0309/wsl2_linux_kernel_usbcam_enable_conf)  
  
2. When you reach the `sudo wget [github.com](http://github.com/)...PINTO0309` step, which won't work for newer kernel versions, follow this video instead or alternatively follow the video tutorial from the beginning: 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_YnACEPmrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_YnACEPmrM)  
  
Additional info: [https://askubuntu.com/questions/1413377/camera-not-working-in-cheese-in-wsl2](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1413377/camera-not-working-in-cheese-in-wsl2)  
  
3. After rebuilding, restart WSL with the new kernel. 
  
#### 4. Set Up Deep-Live-Cam Project  
 Within Ubuntu:
1. Clone the repository:  
  
```bash  
git clone [https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam](https://github.com/hacksider/Deep-Live-Cam)  
```  
  
2. Follow the installation instructions in the repository, including cuda toolkit 11.8, make 100% sure it's not cuda toolkit 12.x.  
   
#### 5. Verify and Load Kernel Modules  
  
1. Check if USB and webcam modules are built into the kernel:  
  
```bash  
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep -i "CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS"  
```  
  
2. If modules are loadable (m), not built-in (y), check if the file exists:  
  
```bash  
ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/media/usb/uvc/  
```  
  
3. Load the module and check for errors (optional if built-in):  
  
```bash  
sudo modprobe uvcvideo  
dmesg | tail  
```  
  
4. Verify video devices:  
  
```bash  
sudo ls -al /dev/video*  
```  
  
#### 6. Set Up Permissions  
  
1. Add user to video group and set permissions:  
  
```bash  
sudo usermod -a -G video $USER  
sudo chgrp video /dev/video0 /dev/video1  
sudo chmod 660 /dev/video0 /dev/video1  
```  
  
2. Create a udev rule for permanent permissions:  
  
```bash  
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/81-webcam.rules  
```  
  
Add this content:  
  
```  
KERNEL=="video[0-9]*", GROUP="video", MODE="0660"  
```  
  
3. Reload udev rules:  
  
```bash  
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger  
```  
  
4. Log out and log back into your WSL session.  
  
5. Start Deep-Live-Cam with `python run.py --execution-provider cuda --max-memory 8` where 8 can be changed to the number of GB VRAM of your GPU has, minus 1-2GB. If you have a RTX3080 with 10GB I suggest adding 8GB. Leave some left for Windows.

#### Final Notes  
  
- Steps 6 and 7 may be optional if the modules are built into the kernel and permissions are already set correctly.  
- Always ensure you're using compatible versions of CUDA, ONNX, and other dependencies.  
- If issues persist, consider checking the Deep-Live-Cam project's specific requirements and troubleshooting steps.  
  
By following these steps, you should have a WSL2 Ubuntu environment with USB webcam support ready for the Deep-Live-Cam project. If you encounter any issues, refer back to the specific error messages and troubleshooting steps provided.

#### Troubleshooting CUDA Issues  

If you encounter this error:  
  
```  
[ONNXRuntimeError] : 1 : FAIL : Failed to load library [libonnxruntime_providers_cuda.so](http://libonnxruntime_providers_cuda.so/) with error: libcufft.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory  
```  
  
Follow these steps:  
  
1. Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8 (ONNX 1.16.3 requires CUDA 11.x, not 12.x):  
[https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)  
  select: Linux, x86_64, WSL-Ubuntu, 2.0, deb (local)
2. Check CUDA version:  
  
```bash  
/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc --version  
```  
  
3. If the wrong version is installed, remove it completely:  
[https://askubuntu.com/questions/530043/removing-nvidia-cuda-toolkit-and-installing-new-one](https://askubuntu.com/questions/530043/removing-nvidia-cuda-toolkit-and-installing-new-one)  
  
4. Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8 again [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive), select: Linux, x86_64, WSL-Ubuntu, 2.0, deb (local)
  
```bash  
sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-11-8  
```
